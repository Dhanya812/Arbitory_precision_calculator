# Arbitory_precision_calculator
This project aims to develop a software application capable of performing mathematical calculations on numbers with an unlimited number of digits, meaning the precision of the result is only limited by the available system memory, unlike standard calculators which have fixed precision due to data type limitations
Languages and technologies used : C language – Functions, Pointers, Structures, Command line arguments ,Data Structures – Double Linked List.
